# Neuhub Widgets for Hubzilla

* By [Federated Works](https://federated.works)
* Website: [Neuhub.org](https://neuhub.org)
* Extends: [Hubzilla](https://hubzilla.org)

This repository is part of a trio. 

* https://framagit.org/federated-works/neuhub/hubzilla-themes
* https://framagit.org/federated-works/neuhub/hubzilla-addons
* https://framagit.org/federated-works/neuhub/hubzilla-widgets

Typically, Neuhub themes require certain addons and widgets, which means you would install all three.

You can add Neuhub themes, addons, and widgets by executing the following commands. 
```
util/add_theme_repo https://framagit.org/federated-works/neuhub/hubzilla-themes.git neuhubthemes
util/add_addon_repo https://framagit.org/federated-works/neuhub/hubzilla-addons.git neuhubaddons
util/add_widget_repo https://framagit.org/federated-works/neuhub/hubzilla-widgets.git neuhubwidgets
```
See the Hubzilla INSTALL.txt file for more details. (More thorough instructions will be added here later.)

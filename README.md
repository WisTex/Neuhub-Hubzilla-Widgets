Typically, Neuhub themes require certain addons and widgets, which means you would install all three.

You can add Neuhub themes, addons, and widgets by executing the following commands. 
```
util/add_theme_repo https://github.com/WisTex/Neuhub-Hubzilla-Themes.git neuhubthemes
util/add_addon_repo https://github.com/WisTex/Neuhub-Hubzilla-Addons.git neuhubaddons
util/add_widget_repo https://github.com/WisTex/Neuhub-Hubzilla-Widgets.git neuhubwidgets
```
See the Hubzilla INSTALL.text file for more details. (More thorough instructions will be added here later.)
